# Mondrian-Painting-CSS
 This project showcases my newly acquired skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox by creating a digital painting inspired by the artist Piet Mondrian. The layout and design elements emulate Mondrian's iconic abstract style, characterized by bold lines, geometric shapes, and primary colors, demonstrating the creative potential of these powerful CSS tools.
